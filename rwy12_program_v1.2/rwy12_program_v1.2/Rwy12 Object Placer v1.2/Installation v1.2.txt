Rwy12 ObjectPlacer v1.2 Program and Libraries Installation
========================================================== 

1. Version 1.2
============== 
This version includes the program and all 39 libraries published so far. The download is divided into 4 zip files because of the total size;
rwy12_Program_v1.2.zip – the program with documentation
rwy12_Lib1_v1.2.zip – object libraries part 1
rwy12_Lib2_v1.2.zip – object libraries part 2
rwy12_Lib3_v1.2.zip – object libraries part 3
Many members of our community don’t have yet a broad band connection so the maximum size of one zip file should not be higher than 30-35 mb. Anyway, to enjoy the full capacity of Rwy12, you have to download and install all 4 files.

What has changed in the Program since version 1.1
The following changes and correction have been made in version 1.2;
- Installation is manual and not by an automatic installer.
- Third party programs are not supplied with the upload but links are given to corresponding download sites.
- All object libraries accumulated so far are included in this download
- The tutorial has been updated
- Synchronization between Rwy12 and FS9 has been changed to yes\no positions.
- You can chose between AGL and above MSL
- You can chose between altitudes in meters and feet.
- The problem of dot\comma for coordinates in certain O/S languages was fixed.
- So are coordinates between 0-10 West and south which caused incorrect object placement.
- A letter for W, E, S, N, is added to coordinates.
- A generate scenery button was added to the main program window.
- The program window can not be resized (and distorted by doing that). The new size is big enough to show the object image clearly.

2.Rwy12 Object Placer Program Installation
============================================
1. Download all 4 zip files and unzip them to 4 temporary folders (not in FS2004).

2. Copy the entire Rwy12 Object Placer v1.2 folder into your C:\ drive. This is a stand alone program that doesn’t need to go into the C:\programs.

3. Browse to the new folder and you will find there 3 sub-folders. 1 of them is an information folder (Tutorials). You can keep it where itis or move it somewhere else. Keep the Templates folder in Rwy12, though you probably will never need it.

4.Navigate back to your desktop (if you are not already there) and create a shortcut of the program by right clicking anywhere on the screen and selecting NEW and then SHORTCUT.  This shortcut will be to the ObjectPlacer.exe file   .) which is in the RWY12 folder that you just placed on your C:\ drive.  After browsing to the location and selecting the .exe file, name the shortcut RWY12 Object Placer.

3.Rwy12 Object Placer Library Installation
===========================================
The download has 39 object libraries in 3 zip files. You must install all of them in order to make Rwy12 work properly. #1 library is the basic library and #2 and #3 are additions that will be installed differently;
 
1.rwy12_lib1_v1.2 - Copy the entire Static Objects Library folder to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Addon Scenery. (C:\ is the drive where you have your FS9. If different – change the paste target). Keep documentation, if any, somewhere else.

2.rwy12_lib2_v1.2 – copy only the Scenery files and Texture files (not the folders) into the newly created Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Addon Scenery\Scenery (and into Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Addon Scenery\Texture). You may be asked to overwrite some texture files, Please do so. 

Keep documentation, if any, somewhere else.

3.rwy12_lib3_v1.2 – same as 2 above.

4.Two more Things to do
========================
1.Go to your FSUIPC download. Unzip it and copy one file; FSUIPC.dll to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Modules

2.You must “activate” the Static Objects Library folder that you placed in your Addon Scenery folder. This is done just as you would activate any scenery addition. Static Objects Library is actually a “virtual” or “reference” scenery and is recognized by FS9 as a normal add-on scenery.
For those who don’t know how to do that,  here is an explanation; Open FS9 and go to Setting\Scenery Library\Add Area , select Addon Scenery\Static Objects Library. click OK to add this new scenery and exit FS9. Next time you start the simulator the new scenery will be activated. (Static Objects Library is a virtual scenery where all the library objects and their textures are kept, without it Rwy12 will not function)
That’s all. Enjoy your new Rwy12 Object Placer. We strongly recommend to read the tutorials, or at least part of them, which will take some time but will save a lot of that stuff later on.

4. Un-Installation of Rwy12 Object Placer
=========================================
Microsoft programs by returning to an earlier Restore Point
Delete all files\folders created in C:\Rwy12 Object Placer
Open FS2004 and go to Setting\Scenery Library\Delete Area , and delete the Static Objects Library
Delete all files created in (X):\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\addon scenery\scenery and \texture.
